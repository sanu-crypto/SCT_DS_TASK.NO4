## 🚦 Task 4: Traffic Accident Pattern Analysis

In this task, I analyzed traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to:

- ⏰ **Time of day** – Identified peak accident hours
- 📅 **Day of week** – Determined accident trends across weekdays and weekends
- 🌦️ **Weather conditions** – Visualized top weather conditions during accidents
- 🛣️ **Road environment** – Explored impact of junctions, crossings, etc.
- 📍 **Geospatial hotspots** – Created a heatmap of accident-prone locations using Folium

### 📊 Key Techniques Used
- Pandas for data processing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Folium & HeatMap for location-based plotting

### 📁 Output
- Accident trend plots (hour, day, weather)
- Heatmap: `accident_hotspots.html` (interactive)
- Cleaned dataset: `accidents_cleaned.csv`
